    <p> Booze and Books is a group dedicated to
      providing people with good books and great
      cocktails. Going to a "Book Club" is a great
      idea (in theory).  Unfortunately, not everyone
      has the luxury of being able to leave their house
      once or twice a month. </p>


      <h3>THAT'S WHERE WE COME IN!</h3>

    <p> Our main goal is to to provide good book suggestions
      and great cocktails to go with them.
      Books can take us to many different places,
      and what better way to enjoy that trip than
      with the appropriate beverage to accompany you.
      Reading a heavy, emotionally-filled book
      like <span class="booktitle">Moby Dick</span> could require a cocktail
       like a <span class="nice-to-know">Dark and Stormy,</span> while a fun read
       such as Mindy Kaling's <span class="booktitle">Is Everyone
       Hanging out without Me?</span> would pair
       great with a crisp glass of <span class="nice-to-know">Chardonnay</span>.</p>


      <p> Join us as we launch our online book club
        communuity.  We will provide great books and
        <span class="big"> even better cocktails.</span>

        <p>We want to keep this a very positive and upbeat
          environment, so we ask that you join this group only
          if you are an avid reader (or are looking to become one)
          and are looking to have a good time.  We ask that you do
          your very best to finish each book before
          the "meeting" so you are able to participate in the dicussion
          and review of the book.  Our main goal is to learn about new books,
          great cocktails, and to <span class="big nice-to-know"> have fun</span>.</p>
