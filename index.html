	<p>They're keeping the whole world guessing as to the identity of 'Becky with the good hair.'</p>
	<p>Beyonce has dropped a clanger of EPIC proportions with Lemonade, and the world is still struggling to come to terms with all those hints and hidden meanings.</p>

	<p>The singer didn't need to say it twice when she appeared to tell 'cheating hubby Jay Z' to go and call 'Becky with the good hair'.</p>

	<p>The Sorry singer dropped the lyric bomb in her new visual album, Lemonade, at the weekend and the rumour mill has gone into overdrive after Bey seemed to confirm the star's rumoured fling behind her back.</p>

	<p>Since then, fashion designer Rachel Roy has been accused of being the mysterious 'Becky', as has Rita Ora, as have a whole load of other artists.</p>

	<p>"I don’t think Beyoncé is calling out one girl. It is many girls. The rumors have been around for years," a source told PageSix.com.  On the other hand, maybe it's one of the many women Jay-Z is alleged to have had affairs with.</p>
