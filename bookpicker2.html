        <p class ="toggler">  Bernadette Fox is notorious. To her Microsoft-guru husband,
            she's a fearlessly opinionated partner; to fellow private-school
            mothers in Seattle, she's a disgrace; to design mavens, she's a
            revolutionary architect, and to 15-year-old Bee,
            she is a best friend and, simply, Mom. Then Bernadette disappears.</p>

          <p class ="toggler">Sage Singer befriends an old man who's particularly beloved in
              her community. Josef Weber is everyone's favorite retired teacher
              and Little League coach. They strike up a friendship at the
              bakery where Sage works. One day he asks Sage for a favor: to
              kill him. Shocked, Sage refuses... and then he confesses his
              darkest secret — he deserves to die, because he was a Nazi SS guard.
              Complicating the matter? Sage's grandmother is a Holocaust survivor.

              <br>What do you do when evil lives next door? Can someone who's
                committed a truly heinous act ever atone for it with subsequent
                good behavior? Should you offer forgiveness to someone if you
                aren't the party who was wronged? And most of all—if Sage even
                considers his request — is it murder, or justice?</p>

        <p class ="toggler">In this hilarious, deliciously skewed collection, Chelsea mines her
            past for stories about her family, relationships, and career that
            are at once singular and ridiculous. Whether she's convincing her
            third-grade class that she has been tapped to play Goldie Hawn's
            daughter in the sequel to Private Benjamin, deciding to be more
            egalitarian by dating a redhead, or looking out for a foulmouthed,
            rum-swilling little person who looks just like her... only smaller,
            Chelsea has a knack for getting herself into the most outrageous
            situations. 

            <br>Are You There, Vodka? It's Me, Chelsea showcases the candor
              and irresistible turns of phrase that have made her one of the
              freshest voices in comedy today</p>

          <p class ="toggler">Bringing Chicago circa 1893 to vivid life, Erik Larson's
            spellbinding bestseller intertwines the true tale of
            two men--the brilliant architect behind the legendary
            1893 World's Fair, striving to secure America's place
            in the world; and the cunning serial killer who used
            the fair to lure his victims to their death. Combining
            meticulous research with nail-biting storytelling, Erik
            Larson has crafted a narrative with all the wonder of
            newly discovered history and the thrills of the best fiction. 

            <br>"As absorbing a piece of popular history as one will ever
              hope to find." --San Francisco Chronicle</p>
