        <p><span class="booktitle"> Are you there Vodka? It's me, Chelsea</span>
        by <span class="nice-to-know"> Chelsea Handler</p>
          <img src="https://d.gr-assets.com/books/1215803088l/40173.jpg"><br>
          <p>In this hilarious, deliciously skewed collection, Chelsea mines her
            past for stories about her family, relationships, and career that
            are at once singular and ridiculous. Whether she's convincing her
            third-grade class that she has been tapped to play Goldie Hawn's
            daughter in the sequel to Private Benjamin, deciding to be more
            egalitarian by dating a redhead, or looking out for a foulmouthed,
            rum-swilling little person who looks just like her... only smaller,
            Chelsea has a knack for getting herself into the most outrageous
            situations. </p>

            <p>Are You There, Vodka? It's Me, Chelsea showcases the candor
              and irresistible turns of phrase that have made her one of the
              freshest voices in comedy today</p>
