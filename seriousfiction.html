          <p>Sage Singer befriends an old man who's particularly beloved in
            her community. Josef Weber is everyone's favorite retired teacher
            and Little League coach. They strike up a friendship at the
            bakery where Sage works. One day he asks Sage for a favor: to
            kill him. Shocked, Sage refuses... and then he confesses his
            darkest secret—he deserves to die, because he was a Nazi SS guard.
            Complicating the matter? Sage's grandmother is a Holocaust survivor.</p>

            <p>What do you do when evil lives next door? Can someone who's
              committed a truly heinous act ever atone for it with subsequent
              good behavior? Should you offer forgiveness to someone if you
              aren't the party who was wronged? And most of all—if Sage even
              considers his request—is it murder, or justice?</p>
